// Objectives
// Define what a Binary Heap is
// Compare and contrast min and max heaps
// Implement basic methods on heaps
// Understand where heaps are used in the real world and what other data structures can be constructed from heaps

// What is A Binary Heap
// Very similar to a binary search tree but with some different rules
// In a Max Binary Heap, parent nodes are always larger than child nodes
// In a Min Binary Heap, parent nodes are always smaller than child nodes

// Max Binary Heap
// Each parent has at most two child nodes
// The value of each parent node is always greater than its child nodes
// The parent is greater than the child but there are no guarantees with sibling nodes
// A Binary Heap is as compact as possible. All the children of each node are as full as they can be and left children are filled out first

// Why do we need to know this?
// Binary Heaps are use to implement Priority Queues, which are very commonly used data structures
// They are also used quite a bit with graph traversal algorithms
